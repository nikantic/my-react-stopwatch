# React Stopwatch

This is a simple React Stopwatch App done in React. I made this app from scratch to practice and improve my React and ES6 skills and also learn something new. Deployed on Zeit.

It features:

- Core concurrent Stopwatch component
- Saved Results component to display results
- Button component
- Day / Night mode with CSS variables
- Cool design and UX done with SVGs
